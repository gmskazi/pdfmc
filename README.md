## PDF CLI tool

Pdfmc stands for PDF Merge Crypt.

A simple PDF tool to merge and encrypt files, I've created this tool to learn more about golang,
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and
[lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss), but after creating it, I've started using it and added it to my
toolkit. Hoping to add more functionality to it when I have the time.

## Install

### If you have golang installed

---

```bash
go install github.com/gmskazi/pdfmc@latest
```

This installs a go binary that will automatically bind to your $GOPATH.
> If you're using ZSH, you'll need to add it manually to ~/.zshrc.

```bash
GOPATH=$HOME/go PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

Reload your zshrc config

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
